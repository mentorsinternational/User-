# Mentors International - UI Design

This project is part of Lambda's Build Week objectives.

## Mission and Objectives

Building apps together in teams to demonstrate your mastery over the material you have thus far learned at Lambda School, preparing you to enter the job force one project at a time.

 The Objectives for an effective build week are:

- Allow each student to demonstrate their proficiency across the objectives learned over the last 4 weeks at Lambda School.
- Prepare each student in their respective section to develop a firm understanding of how Lambda Labs operates.
- Provide students with as many opportunities as possible to learn what it's like to develop software in a real world environment.
- Provide students time to develop at least 5 projects worthy of professional portfolio during their time at Lambda School.
- Encourage cross section and cross course collaboration amongst our student body.
