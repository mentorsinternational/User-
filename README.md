- Pre-Processors
- JavaScript Fundamentals
- DOM
- Components

### MVP Objectives

- [x] Performed proper git merges and pull requests to get code to the codebase
- [x] Pair programmed with the Front End Architect

**HTML/CSS**

- [x] CSS fundamentals such as box model, flexbox, and positioning were used appropriately
- [x] Code is clean and organise with proper indentation
- [x] A library or framework was researched and used

**Responsiveness**

- [x] No horizontal scrollbars exist
- [x] Built using mobile-first design with tablet and desktop breakpoints

**JavaScript Fundamentals**

- [x] No errors in the console when opening the web page
- [x] Array methods were used
- [x] Constructors were used to build new objects

**Applied JavaScript**

- [x] Event Listeners were used
- [x] DOM manipulation occurred
- [x] A reusable component was built

### Libraries & Frameworks

**[Marketing Page](index.html)**

This is the homepage which includes content and copy that relates to the product that our team was working on. Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides are included.

**[Teams Page](team.html)**

A section that includes images of the members of our team, and links to their socials/Github.

## Project Set Up

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

- Fork the project into your GitHub user account
- Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
- Create your own branch to work off of
- You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

### Task 2: Set up your preprocessor

- Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc -v` in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, you'll need to install it.
- Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the `cd` command
- Once in your project's root folder, run the following command `less-watch-compiler less css style.less`
- Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background-color` on the `html` selector to `red` in your `style.less` file.
- Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start coding
